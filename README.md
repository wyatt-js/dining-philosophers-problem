Assignment Directions:

Using Java, and threads in Java, program a solution to the Dining Philosophers problem, a classic problem in concurrent computation. Use judicious output to show what is going on in your simulation as it executes. Make sure your solution avoids deadlocks, starvations, and race conditions.

In your readme file for the zipfile, explain your design rationale. What features and structures are you using to represent the philosophers? To represent the table, the forks, the spaghetti? To represent eating phase of a philosophers "life"... the thinking phase?

What does your algorithm do to help prevent deadlocks and starvation? Are deadlocks and/or starvations still possible (and just improbable)?
